        <p>Dear Siddhant,</p>
        <p>I want you to know how much you mean to me.</p>
        <p>You are my everything, my heart, my soul.</p>
        <p>I love you more than words can ever express.</p>
        <p>With you, I've found my forever home.</p>
        <p>And I know everything feels so helpless right now, but there's one thing that WE do best babe, and that is loving each other.</p>
        <p>Even when one of us is suffering, the other is always there, and I understand it has become so draining for you.</p>
        <p>But I want you to know that I'm crazy, hopelessly in love with you forever.</p>
        <p>Consider this project a little token of effort, this and a hell lot more I'm willing to put in for us because you deserve that, babe. You are worth all the effort in the world and I promise we can get through this.</p>
